Forked from carrykh, I have made some slight modifications for the mass processing of lecture videos. This operation is very resource hungry and the original source code needs a lot of work done to it. I have come up with some slight bodges (for personal use) to make the process a little bit quicker.
I might look into optimising the script later, so the process can be lightened for future application.

## My Additions:
I have added some handy sh scripts to automate the process.
