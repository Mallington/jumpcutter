# jumpcutter
This program lets you reduce the time of your lecture videos by 25% on average (depending on lecturer). It does this by speeding up the parts of the video where the audio decreases below a certain level, then pauses and silence which usually take up time are removed.
This was forked from carrykh/jumpcutter, I have made some slight modifications for the mass processing of lecture videos. This operation is very resource hungry and the original source code needs a lot of work done to it. I have come up with some slight bodges (for personal use) to make the process a little bit quicker.
I will look into optimising the original python script at a later date, so the process can be lightened for future application.

## My Additions:
I have added some handy sh scripts to automate the process.
